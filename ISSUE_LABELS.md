# Issue Labels

Here is a quick description of the Labels that can be applied to issues and how they affect you:

* Enchancement - A suggestion rather than a bug.
* Open Project - This is an issue that has been approved, but is not likely to recieve any attention from CovertJaguar in the near future. Others are welcomed to tackle them and can be fairly confident of them being merged into the codebase.
* Merge Into Dev - Your PR has been approved and has been merged into CovertJaguar's personal dev branch for testing. The PR will be closed when the dev branch gets merged into master for an official release.
* Bug-Major - These are bugs which prevent normal usage of either the entire mod or significant portions of it. Consider these high priority. Any help is welcomed.
* Bug-Minor - These are mostly just annoyances that can be safely ignored or worked around. Again, any help is welcomed on resolving these.
* Duplicate - These issues have been reported multiple times.
* Fix In Next Update - The issue has been fixed, but only in CovertJaguar's personal dev branch, it will be merged into master eventually.
* Fixed - The issue is resolved, and probably closed. This label is often forgotten when closing fixed issues.
* Need More Info - The issue is lacking key information or is otherwise not clear. If this is a suggestion issue, please be as specific as possible. If its a bug report, you didn't provide enough information to reproduce or fix the error. Issues that continue to lack info will eventually be discarded.
* Question - These issue are ones where the submitter is asking a question. Once the question is answered they will be closed.
* Needs Verification - Bug reports are often given this tag when first reported. It indicated that this issue hasn't been reproduced and that only a single person has reported seeing it. It also hasn't been proven that the issue isn't the result of a cross-mod interaction. If a report remains unverified for a signifcant amount of time, it is typcially discarded.
* Not my Issue - These are bugs that are usually caused by interaction from another mod or that are misidentified as a Railcraft issue when really they are not.
* Not a Bug - Working as intended. These issues are not open for discusion usually.
* Wontfix - Might be a bug, but its either too annoying or impossible to fix. Or it is an intentional design decision.
